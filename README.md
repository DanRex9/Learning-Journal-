Here we got the brief for this module and i started to think on what i wanted to do tutorials of. I first only started to think of different typs of tutorials and on what to do my tutorials of. After some thinking i just went with the options of making my first tutorial on how to make a shooting mechanic, this is because action games are my prefered genres.

After our lesson i made some research on what timpe of shooting mechanics i wanted to do, my initial idas for a simple shooting mechanic for a 2d platformer game but i came across a very well tutorial video on how to have an FPS shooting mechanic, it was easy to undertstand and i really liked it so i decide to follow this video and make my first tutorial.

First when i started to follow the video i only followed the video to the part where he creates the gun, but as soon as he started with the scripting i got stuck because i knew that i could copy the script but i wouldnt understand it so i spent the whole lesson understanding the script and how some of the coding worked.

I asked Paul to help me explain the coding that was being used for my tutorial, i had some issues with following the code, there where parts were i had errors in unity due to the code, i went over the script mulitiple times but i couldnt find any errors, with Pauls helps he found some simple spelling mistakes i had done or `;` that i forgot to add. I had a lot of difficulty balancing the making of my tytorial and keeping up with the learning journal, but keeping small notes on my phone helped me.

26/11/2024 I encountered problems like making both scripts from differen tutorials work, making the shooing button work, making the script in my fps game work and making sure the script was correct. making object destroy when coming in contact with bullets, making the gun follow the camera view. changing update to Udate is crucial as this was the source of my problem.
i didnt add the script to my bullet before making it a prefab getting me stuck for some time in why my bullets where not destroying any gameobjects.
