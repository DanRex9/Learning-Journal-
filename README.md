Here we got the brief for this module and i started to think on what i wanted to do tutorials of. I first only started to think of different typs of tutorials and on what to do my tutorials of. After some thinking i just went with the options of making my first tutorial on how to make a shooting mechanic, this is because action games are my prefered genres.


## 21 / 10 / 24

After our lesson i made some research on what timpe of shooting mechanics i wanted to do, my initial idas for a simple shooting mechanic for a 2d platformer game but i came across a very well tutorial video on how to have an FPS shooting mechanic, it was easy to undertstand and i really liked it so i decide to follow this video and make my first tutorial.

First when i started to follow the video i only followed the video to the part where he creates the gun, but as soon as he started with the scripting i got stuck because i knew that i could copy the script but i wouldnt understand it so i spent the whole lesson understanding the script and how some of the coding worked.

I asked Paul to help me explain the coding that was being used for my tutorial, i had some issues with following the code, there where parts were i had errors in unity due to the code, i went over the script mulitiple times but i couldnt find any errors, with Pauls helps he found some simple spelling mistakes i had done or `;` that i forgot to add. I had a lot of difficulty balancing the making of my tytorial and keeping up with the learning journal, but keeping small notes on my phone helped me.

After making my tutorial and seeing how much i liked the fps shooting mechanic, for my prototype game i wanted to implement the same mechanic but with addidng movement, i knew this will be complicated but i started to do research and watching any videos that i could use. I saw many tutorials but they were very complex and i didnt get to choose.

I found a video that i liked, that talked about how to make movement for fps games, i decide to use the this video although it only showed movement i wanted to try because it would challenge me to merge 2 separate scripts and try make them work together.

In the lesson i explained to the class that i wanted to start my prototype, i made this decision of making the prototype before finishing the rest of the tutorials because i came from making my first prototype and i implemented that tutorial into the prototype aswell as more scripts, i wanted to keep the flow of my work to keep a good work rate. I started to work on the scripting for the prototype and how to merge two different scripts, first i started and i continued until i came across a problem where i couldnt continue. I asked Paul for some help on how i can make the scripts work, he explained some of the script to me and how its works, with this explanation i managed to get a better understanding of both scripts.

I had some problems when making objects destroy went coming into contact with the bullets, and making the gun follow the camera view, the simple solution to this was changing `update` to `Update` this simple mistake had me stuck for almost the whole lesson. I also didnt add the script to my bullet before making it a prefab getting me stuck for some time in why my bullets where not destroying any gameobjects.

a week ago i started to do my second tutorial and it was going to be a tutorial on fps movement, i thought htis would be a good idea since i already had done it with my prototype but after starting to make the tutorial and making the script i had to explain it but since i had taken it from a different tutorial where the script wasnt explainde properly i didnt lnow how to continue, i asked and got told that if im not able to explain the script i could start a different tutoria, and thats what i did. 

## 17 / 12 / 24

I started my second tutorial, carrying the same movement mechanic that i wanted to do in the begining but this time for a 2d platformer, this tutorail was straight forward and didnt have many complications. The tutorial i followed gave very good instructions to follow and the small barriers i crossed was easy to fix.

For my third tutorial my main problem was the undertanding of some of the codes used such as understanding the importance of `Vector2`.

Finishing my final tutorial wasnt much problem, i had a few problems and errors with unity that had i had no idea how to fix, i had to make some research on youtube but i wasnt able to fix it so my work in unity was a bit limited but i still managed to make it work and completed the tutorial with not much dificulty.
