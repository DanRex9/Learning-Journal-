My Journey in Programming 

26/11/2024 I encountered problems like making both scripts from differen tutorials work, making the shooing button work, making the script in my fps game work and making sure the script was correct. making object destroy when coming in contact with bullets, making the gun follow the camera view. changing update to Udate is crucial as this was the source of my problem.
i didnt add the script to my bullet before making it a prefab getting me stuck for some time in why my bullets where not destroying any gameobjects.
